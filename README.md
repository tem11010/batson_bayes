This repository stores the code for "Bayesian Detection of Bias in Peremptory Challenges Using Historical Strike Data," _The American Statistician_ (in press).

This repository contains the code to (1) generate data for simulations; and (2) generate plots of simulations presented in the article manuscript and supplementary material. More details on model specifications are provided in the article manuscript. The key code for running the analyses can be found in: data_generation.R, model.R, and simultaneous_sims.R. All other code is used for cleaning and visualizing the data.
