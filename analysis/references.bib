  Abstract                 = {This article examines the impact of jury racial composition on trial outcomes using a data set of felony trials in Florida between 2000 and 2010. We use a research design that exploits day-to-day variation in the composition of the jury pool to isolate quasi-random variation in the composition of the seated jury, finding evidence that (i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member. The impact of jury race is much greater than what a simple correlation of the race of the seated jury and conviction rates would suggest. These findings imply that the application of justice is highly uneven and raise obvious concerns about the fairness of trials in jurisdictions with a small proportion of blacks in the jury pool.},

In fact, 39 of the 50 states fail to provide access to the one set of records that defendants must have in order to enforce the right. This Article analyzes and critiques state court doctrine that elevates administrative concerns over the fair cross-section right, and concludes by proposing solutions that could accommodate courts’ concerns without jeopardizing the fair cross-section guarantee.},

Limited information exists about the specific sources of these disparities and the frequency of all-white and mostly-white juries. This study compares the racial diversity of venires to that of panels, and both to the general population, to identify the steps in the jury-selection process that appear to be most strongly implicated in the loss of minorities. Additionally, the present analyses examine the for-cause and peremptory-challenge removals of jurors of different races. Finally, this study investigates the prevalence of all-white and mostly-white juries. The results have implications for enhancing the representation of minorities on both venires and panels.},

We present data from federal courts on the composition of jury pools in 52 areas, representing 764 counties. We also compare current composition estimates to those available 20 years ago from published sources. Results show that, by far, some amount of underrepresentation in jury pools is the norm, and levels of attrition fail all but one proposed method for calculating and defining “not fair and reasonable” amounts of underrepresentation. On average, expected losses range between one and three members of each minority group from jury venires of 40 to 60 people. We find no evidence that the impact of attrition on Latino communities is greater than on African‐American communities and, unlike Latinos, no indicators of African‐American representation levels show improvement over time. We discuss the challenges of addressing racial/ethnic attrition in jury pools, which is evident but, given the repeated small group sampling of venires, may be small in effect in any single case.},

  abstract  = { The process of jury selection typically requires opposing counsel to reduce a pool of prospective jurors to the prescribed jury size by alternately excusing or striking individuals from service. These decisions, called peremptory strikes, are executed without the need of revealing any underlying rationale. However, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have held that attorneys may not exercise their peremptory strikes to systematically exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race or gender. The first step in establishing a charge of such improper bias requires the challenging party to show evidence that his or her opponent's strikes are inconsistent with random consideration of these protected characteristics. Since court procedure dictates that there is some alternating between Prosecution and Defense in the striking process, choices for each side impact those of the other, and a simple comparison of the jury pool with the peremptory strikes is insufficient for establishing any inference of bias. For these situations, we present a methodology for assessing the neutrality of juror strikes, based on the Poisson binomial distribution. },

of a cognizable class, and facts sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination. If a prima facie
case is found, the side using the peremptory challenge has the opportunity of explaining its decisions,
and then the court decides whether discrimination has occurred. This article addresses how statistics can
be used to address the strength of evidence provided by the history of the use of peremptory challenges
in a case. It contrasts two different procedures used by judges in the exercise of peremptory challenges.
Frequentist and Bayesian analyses are given for both procedures, using data from a recent cases.},

At the same time, new areas of jury research have been producing important explanations for how the jury goes about reaching its verdict in response to challenging questions, like how to assess damages. Yet the persistent focus on individual juror judgments as opposed to decision making by the jury as a group leaves unanswered important questions about how jury performance is influenced by a primary distinctive feature of the jury: the deliberation process. },

Nevertheless, Black individuals remain substantially more likely than others to be removed during jury selection through peremptory challenges. This study tests whether and to what extent there is a racial effect on peremptory challenge use by the prosecution or the defense. Method:Using data from 2,542 venire members in Mississippi, propensity score matching is used to examine racial differences in jury selection by comparing Black venire members to similarly situated White venire member counterparts.Results:Findings suggest that Black venire members are 4.51 times as likely to be excluded from a jury due to peremptory challenges from the prosecution in comparison to White venire members. Conversely, White venire members are 4.21 times as likely to be excluded through peremptory challenges by the defense in comparison to Black venire members.Conclusions:After controlling for all observed variables, there remain significant differences between White and Black venire members, suggesting racial discrimination by both the prosecution and the defense in peremptory challenge usage. Black individuals are more likely to be excluded from juries through these effects, resulting in less racially diverse juries. }

Nevertheless, court cases and empirical evidence suggest that discrimination on such characteristics, especially race, continues to occur through peremptory challenges. Statistical evidence of the gender effect, however, is more limited and has not previously incorporated controls in race-specific analyses to address non-gender-based explanations for gender differences. The present study examines gender differences in peremptory challenges using data from criminal jury trials in Mississippi. Race-specific analyses and propensity score matching are used to isolate the impact of gender from other measurable effects. Results indicate weak and non-significant gender differences for peremptory challenges used by the prosecution, and weak-to-moderate and non-significant gender differences for peremptory challenges used by the defense. This suggests that gender differences in the use of peremptory challenges may be the result of racial differences and other factors rather than a true gender-based effect.}

The two decision makers each have an opportunity to challenge each item before it is accepted, in some arbitrary fixed order. We assume that the decision makers know the utility function of the other side as well as their own over sets of J items, and that they know the subjective distribution, assigned by the other side, of characteristics of potential items that will be observed, as well as their own. Under these conditions the other side's response to each potential item can be predicted with certainty, and backward induction defines an optimal strategy. We study an important special case we call regular, and show that it is never disadvantageous to go first in the regular case. The use of peremptory challenges in jury trials motivates our model. The basic model in which jurors are challenged one at a time is extended to a more general class of problems that includes the group system and the struck jury system.},

It has been used in clinical trials, genetics, health care, psychology, environmental health, engineering, economics, and business. It has also been applied for a wide variety of models and settings, both in the experimental design and analysis contexts. In this review article, we give an A-to-Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Frequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established, and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = "{The North Carolina Racial Justice Act allows defendants to submit statistical studies of prosecutorial actions pertaining to their seeking the death penalty or in making peremptory challenges. These studies may consider data from four geographical regions: the state, county, judicial division or prosecutorial district. A study of the effect of race on peremptory challenges in death penalty cases demonstrating statistically significant disparities disadvantaging Black defendants has been submitted in several cases. This comment shows that a more appropriate statistical analysis yields much stronger statistical evidence that race entered into the peremptory challenge process in Randolph County than the affidavit submitted by the authors of the study. A subsequent sensitivity analysis indicates that in order for a characteristic to explain the highly statistically significant disparity, it would need to increase the odds of an individual being challenged by a factor of three and more than twice as many Black venire members would need to possess that characteristic as non-Blacks. Since the data examined excluded potential jurors who had been removed for cause, it may be difficult for the state to find a legitimate reason justifying the racial disparity.}",

The theory underlying hypothesis testing is also concerned with the power of the test to detect a meaningful difference. This article shows that using the insights provided by power calculations should assist courts to better interpret and evaluate the statistical analyses submitted into evidence. In particular, the concept of power should help in assessing whether a sample is too small to provide reliable inferences. On the other hand very large samples can classify minor differences as statistically significant. This occurs when the power of the test at the standard 0.05 level is very high. It will be seen that requiring significance at a more stringent level, e.g. 0.005, which can be determined from a power calculation, often resolves this problem.}",

    abstract = {This review collects initiatives and legal decisions designed to mitigate discrimination in pretrial decision making, jury selection, jury unanimity, and jury deliberations. It also reviews initiatives to interrupt implicit racial biases. Among these, Washington's new rule for jury selection stands alone in treating racism as the product of both individual actors’ decisions and long-standing legal structures. Washington's rule shows the limits of recent US Supreme Court decisions addressing discrimination in cases with unusual and clearly problematic facts. The court presents these cases as rare remediable aberrations, ignoring the well-documented history of racism in jury selection. The final section juxtaposes limited reforms with the contemporary prison abolitionist movement to illuminate boundaries of incremental reforms. Reforms must reflect cognizance of the extent to which racism exists at multiple levels. Reforms that do not are less likely to make change, because they are either narrow in scope or focused on discrimination by individuals. }

The validity of this assumption has been questioned for cases involving racial minority members, in that racial bias among jury members may influence jury decisions. The current research shows that legal professionals are adept at identifying jurors with levels of implicit race bias that are consistent with their legal interests. Using a simulated voir dire, professionals assigned to the role of defense lawyer for a Black defendant were more likely to exclude jurors with high levels of implicit race bias, whereas prosecutors of a Black defendant did the opposite. There was no relation between professionals’ peremptory challenges and jurors’ levels of explicit race bias. Implications for the role of racial bias in legal decision making are discussed. }

It is neither the same as the legal designation of which party has the burden of proof with respect to a particular matter, nor the standard of proof that must be met for that party to prevail. The recent case of Idaho v. Ish raises the question of how to find such priors, particularly in a doubly constrained 2 × 2 table with a zero. This article re-examines this issue. It also offers reflection on whether, given a zero in the table (which here means that all members of a particular race or sex are excluded from jury service), it matters how many are excluded.}",
