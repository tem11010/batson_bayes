abstract = {Summary Bayesian clinical trial designs offer the possibility of a substantially reduced sample size, increased statistical power, and reductions in cost and ethical hazard. However when prior and current information conflict, Bayesian methods can lead to higher than expected type I error, as well as the possibility of a costlier and lengthier trial. This motivates an investigation of the feasibility of hierarchical Bayesian methods for incorporating historical data that are adaptively robust to prior information that reveals itself to be inconsistent with the accumulating experimental data. In this article, we present several models that allow for the commensurability of the information in the historical and current data to determine how much historical information is used. A primary tool is elaborating the traditional power prior approach based upon a measure of commensurability for Gaussian data. We compare the frequentist performance of several methods using simulations, and close with an example of a colon cancer trial that illustrates a linear models extension of our adaptive borrowing approach. Our proposed methods produce more precise estimates of the model parameters, in particular, conferring statistical significance to the observed reduction in tumor size for the experimental regimen as compared to the control regimen.},

  abstract  = { The process of jury selection typically requires opposing counsel to reduce a pool of prospective jurors to the prescribed jury size by alternately excusing or striking individuals from service. These decisions, called peremptory strikes, are executed without the need of revealing any underlying rationale. However, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have held that attorneys may not exercise their peremptory strikes to systematically exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race or gender. The first step in establishing a charge of such improper bias requires the challenging party to show evidence that his or her opponent's strikes are inconsistent with random consideration of these protected characteristics. Since court procedure dictates that there is some alternating between Prosecution and Defense in the striking process, choices for each side impact those of the other, and a simple comparison of the jury pool with the peremptory strikes is insufficient for establishing any inference of bias. For these situations, we present a methodology for assessing the neutrality of juror strikes, based on the Poisson binomial distribution. },

jury selection in ways that disproportionately eliminate cognizable classes: by race, sex, ethnicity, etc.
The court designed a three-stage process: a prima facie case requires a timely objection, the identification
of a cognizable class, and facts sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination. If a prima facie
case is found, the side using the peremptory challenge has the opportunity of explaining its decisions,
and then the court decides whether discrimination has occurred. This article addresses how statistics can
be used to address the strength of evidence provided by the history of the use of peremptory challenges
in a case. It contrasts two different procedures used by judges in the exercise of peremptory challenges.
Frequentist and Bayesian analyses are given for both procedures, using data from a recent cases.},

Nevertheless, Black individuals remain substantially more likely than others to be removed during jury selection through peremptory challenges. This study tests whether and to what extent there is a racial effect on peremptory challenge use by the prosecution or the defense. Method:Using data from 2,542 venire members in Mississippi, propensity score matching is used to examine racial differences in jury selection by comparing Black venire members to similarly situated White venire member counterparts.Results:Findings suggest that Black venire members are 4.51 times as likely to be excluded from a jury due to peremptory challenges from the prosecution in comparison to White venire members. Conversely, White venire members are 4.21 times as likely to be excluded through peremptory challenges by the defense in comparison to Black venire members.Conclusions:After controlling for all observed variables, there remain significant differences between White and Black venire members, suggesting racial discrimination by both the prosecution and the defense in peremptory challenge usage. Black individuals are more likely to be excluded from juries through these effects, resulting in less racially diverse juries. }

abstract = {Gender- and race-based discrimination in jury selection is unconstitutional in the United States. Nevertheless, court cases and empirical evidence suggest that discrimination on such characteristics, especially race, continues to occur through peremptory challenges. Statistical evidence of the gender effect, however, is more limited and has not previously incorporated controls in race-specific analyses to address non-gender-based explanations for gender differences. The present study examines gender differences in peremptory challenges using data from criminal jury trials in Mississippi. Race-specific analyses and propensity score matching are used to isolate the impact of gender from other measurable effects. Results indicate weak and non-significant gender differences for peremptory challenges used by the prosecution, and weak-to-moderate and non-significant gender differences for peremptory challenges used by the defense. This suggests that gender differences in the use of peremptory challenges may be the result of racial differences and other factors rather than a true gender-based effect.}

abstract = {The power prior has been widely used in many applications covering a large number of disciplines. The power prior is intended to be an informative prior constructed from historical data. It has been used in clinical trials, genetics, health care, psychology, environmental health, engineering, economics, and business. It has also been applied for a wide variety of models and settings, both in the experimental design and analysis contexts. In this review article, we give an A-to-Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Frequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established, and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A study of the effect of race on peremptory challenges in death penalty cases demonstrating statistically significant disparities disadvantaging Black defendants has been submitted in several cases. This comment shows that a more appropriate statistical analysis yields much stronger statistical evidence that race entered into the peremptory challenge process in Randolph County than the affidavit submitted by the authors of the study. A subsequent sensitivity analysis indicates that in order for a characteristic to explain the highly statistically significant disparity, it would need to increase the odds of an individual being challenged by a factor of three and more than twice as many Black venire members would need to possess that characteristic as non-Blacks. Since the data examined excluded potential jurors who had been removed for cause, it may be difficult for the state to find a legitimate reason justifying the racial disparity.}",

The theory underlying hypothesis testing is also concerned with the power of the test to detect a meaningful difference. This article shows that using the insights provided by power calculations should assist courts to better interpret and evaluate the statistical analyses submitted into evidence. In particular, the concept of power should help in assessing whether a sample is too small to provide reliable inferences. On the other hand very large samples can classify minor differences as statistically significant. This occurs when the power of the test at the standard 0.05 level is very high. It will be seen that requiring significance at a more stringent level, e.g. 0.005, which can be determined from a power calculation, often resolves this problem.}",

We apply Optimal Feature Selection to identify the globally optimal subset of features and affirm that there is significant evidence of racial bias in the strike decisions. We also use Optimal Classification Trees to segment the juror population subgroups with similar characteristics and probability of being struck, and find that three of these subgroups exhibit significant racial disparity in strike rate, pinpointing specific areas of bias in the dataset.}

abstract = {The power prior is a popular tool for constructing informative prior distributions based on historical data. The method consists of raising the likelihood to a discounting factor in order to control the amount of information borrowed from the historical data. However, one often wishes to assign this discounting factor a prior distribution and estimate it jointly with the parameters, which in turn necessitates the computation of a normalizing constant. In this article, we are concerned with how to approximately sample from joint posterior of the parameters and the discounting factor. We first show a few important properties of the normalizing constant and then use these results to motivate a bisection-type algorithm for computing it on a fixed budget of evaluations. We give a large array of illustrations and discuss cases where the normalizing constant is known in closed-form and where it is not. We show that the proposed method produces approximate posteriors that are very close to the exact distributions and also produces posteriors that cover the data-generating parameters with higher probability in the intractable case. Our results suggest that the proposed method is an accurate and easy to implement technique to include this normalization, being applicable to a large class of models. They also reinforce the notion that proper inclusion of the normalizing constant is crucial to the drawing of correct inferences and appropriate quantification of uncertainty.},

abstract = {Abstract A standard two-arm randomised controlled trial usually compares an intervention to a control treatment with equal numbers of patients randomised to each treatment arm and only data from within the current trial are used to assess the treatment effect. Historical data are used when designing new trials and have recently been considered for use in the analysis when the required number of patients under a standard trial design cannot be achieved. Incorporating historical control data could lead to more efficient trials, reducing the number of controls required in the current study when the historical and current control data agree. However, when the data are inconsistent, there is potential for biased treatment effect estimates, inflated type I error and reduced power. We introduce two novel approaches for binary data which discount historical data based on the agreement with the current trial controls, an equivalence approach and an approach based on tail area probabilities. An adaptive design is used where the allocation ratio is adapted at the interim analysis, randomising fewer patients to control when there is agreement. The historical data are down-weighted in the analysis using the power prior approach with a fixed power. We compare operating characteristics of the proposed design to historical data methods in the literature: the modified power prior; commensurate prior; and robust mixture prior. The equivalence probability weight approach is intuitive and the operating characteristics can be calculated exactly. Furthermore, the equivalence bounds can be chosen to control the maximum possible inflation in type I error.},

abstract = {The power prior and its variations have been proven to be a useful class of informative priors in Bayesian inference due to their flexibility in incorporating the historical information by raising the likelihood of the historical data to a fractional power δ. The derivation of the marginal likelihood based on the original power prior, and its variation, the normalized power prior, introduces a scaling factor C(δ) in the form of a prior predictive distribution with powered likelihood. In this article, we show that the scaling factor might be infinite for some positive δ with conventionally used initial priors, which would change the admissible set of the power parameter. This result seems to have been almost completely ignored in the literature. We then illustrate that such a phenomenon may jeopardize the posterior inference under the power priors when the initial prior of the model parameters is improper. The main findings of this article suggest that special attention should be paid when the suggested level of borrowing is close to 0, while the actual optimum might be below the suggested value. We use a normal linear model as an example for illustrative purposes. }

    abstract = { During drug evaluation trials, information from clinical trials previously conducted on another population, indications or schedules may be available. In these cases, it might be desirable to share information by efficiently using the available resources. In this work, we developed an adaptive power prior with a commensurability parameter for using historical or external information. It allows, at each stage, full borrowing when the data are not in conflict, no borrowing when the data are in conflict or “tuned” borrowing when the data are in between. We propose to apply our adaptive power prior method to bridging studies between Caucasians and Asians, and we focus on the sequential adaptive allocation design, although other design settings can be used. We weight the prior information in two steps: the effective sample size approach is used to set the maximum desirable amount of information to be shared from historical data at each step of the trial; then, in a sort of Empirical Bayes approach, a commensurability parameter is chosen using a measure of distribution distance. This approach avoids elicitation and computational issues regarding the usual Empirical Bayes approach. We propose several versions of our method, and we conducted an extensive simulation study evaluating the robustness and sensitivity to prior choices. }

abstract = {ABSTRACTClinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., ‘borrowing’) this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of ‘dynamic’ (versus ‘static’) borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.},

The Court did not report the results of any formal statistical inference, e.g. a test of the hypothesis that these two proportions were equal. This comment shows that the ultimate finding of discrimination in the case would have been strengthened had the data been analysed by an appropriate test. It is noted that there is more information in the sequential nature of the jury selection process than is currently reported. Thus, further research incorporating this additional data could lead to more powerful statistical tests and more accurate decisions in similar cases.}",
